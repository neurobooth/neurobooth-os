Neurobooth-os
-------------

Neurobooth-os is a python package to initialize, synchronize and record
behavioral and physiological data streams from wearables, D-/RGB cameras, eye tracker,
ECG, mouse and microphone in a booth.

Installations
-------------

We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution. To install neurobooth-os, simply do:

$ pip install -e git+https://github.com/neurobooth/neurobooth-os.git#egg=neurobooth_os

and it will install neurobooth-os along with the dependencies which are not already installed.

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

$ python -c 'import neurobooth_os'

and it should not give any error messages.

Install Pylink running on the STM::

$ pip install --index-url=https://pypi.sr-support.com sr-research-pylink

If pip install from sr-research doesn't work, please follow the following steps:

* Create an sr-research support account
* Download the `EyeLink Developers Kit v2.1.1 (32 and 64 bit)` installer from the SR Research
Support forum.
* Install the Eyelink Developers Kit
* Run: `$ cd C:'\\Program Files (x86)\\SR Research\\EyeLink\\SampleExperiments\\Python\\'`
* Run: `$ python install_pylink.py`

For pyspin FLIR installation on the ACQ: 
Download SDK from https://www.flir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/?vertical=machine+vision&segment=iis
direct link to wheel file: https://flir.app.boxcn.net/v/SpinnakerSDK/file/982785545712
then unzip the file, cd to the folder and run: 
`$  pip install spinnaker_python-2.x.x.x-cp3x-cp3x-win_amd64.whl`


Setup
-----

It requires a postgreSQL database running on a server. Connection is established with the function
`neurobooth_os.iout.metadator.get_conn()`. Currently, as specified in 
`~/.neurobooth_os_secrets` the local IP is 192.168.100.1, and remotely it connects to 
`neurodoor.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu` using the private key in '~/.ssh/id_rsa'.

To setup a private key, first activate the VPN (partner's virtual private network), then run in
the terminal::

$ ssh-keygen
$ ssh-copy-id userID@neurodoor.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu


Next, set up the configuration data. Please see the instructions at:
https://github.com/neurobooth/neurobooth-os/blob/master/docs/system_configuration.md


Run
----

The program runs on 3 different computers and the starting point is
``gui.py``. The computers are:

* CTR (control) computer: This computer hosts the GUI and relays commands
to the other computers to start recording from the Neurobooth devices
and presenting stimuli. The lab recorder software is on this computer.

* STM (stimulus) computer: This computer runs the tasks using ``psychopy``.

* ACQ (acquisition) computer: This computer acquires data.

Each computer has a server that listens for communication from the other
computers in the form of string messages. CTR and STM computer communicate
with the database.

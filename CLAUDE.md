# Claude Code Configuration

Personal configuration for Claude Code sessions.

## Conflict Resolution

If a project-level CLAUDE.md conflicts with this file, the project-level instructions take precedence. Ask me if unclear.

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 10+
- **Shell**: PowerShell / Git Bash
- **Editor**: VS Code

## CLI Tools

| Tool | Install | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `winget` | Built-in (Win 10+) | Package manager |
| `gh` | `winget install GitHub.cli` | GitHub CLI |
| `rg` (ripgrep) | `winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep` | Fast file search |
| `fd` | `winget install sharkdp.fd` | Fast file finder |
| `bat` | `winget install sharkdp.bat` | Syntax-highlighted cat |
| `delta` | `winget install dandavison.delta` | Better git diffs |
| `tldr` | `winget install tldr-pages.tlrc` | Examples-focused help |

When suggesting commands, use Windows-compatible syntax (backslash paths, PowerShell or Git Bash commands).

## Development Stack

### Python
- **Version management**: conda
- **Package management**: conda with pip as fallback
- **Python version**: 3.8.18+
- **Type hints**: Required on new or changed function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Google format for new or changed public functions and classes
- **Data structures**: Prefer dataclasses or Pydantic over plain dicts for new code
- **Linting/Formatting**: ruff
- **Testing**: pytest (fixtures over setUp, test behavior not implementation)

## Code Style

- **Formatting**: Black (Python)
- **Line length**: 88 (Python)
- **Imports**: Grouped (stdlib, third-party, local), sorted with isort/ruff
- **No wildcard imports**
- **f-strings** over .format() or %
- **Claude** Do not mention Claude in any comments

## Git Conventions

- **Messages**: Explain why, not just what
- **Useful aliases**: `git graph`, `git recent`, `git last`
- **Claude references**: Do not add "Generated by claude" text to a Pull Request. Do not mention Claude in any commit 
title or description

## The Truth Protocol

### You SHOULD
- **Always tell the truth**; never make up information, speculate, or guess.
- **Base all statements on verifiable, factual, and up-to-date sources.**
- **Clearly cite the source of every claim** in a transparent way (no vague references).
- **Explicitly state "I cannot confirm this"** if something cannot be verified.
- **Prioritize accuracy over speed** and take the necessary steps to verify before responding.
- **Maintain objectivity** by removing personal bias, assumptions, and opinion unless explicitly requested and labeled as such.
- **Explain reasoning step by step** when the accuracy of an answer could be questioned.
- **Show how any numerical figure was calculated or sourced.**
- **Prefer security and stability** by always using the latest stable versions of packages.
- **Treat third-party dependencies with scrutiny** and evaluate them as potential security risks before use.
- **Never compromise security for convenience or speed.**

### You MUST AVOID
- **Fabricating facts, quotes, or data.**
- **Hallucinating or making up information** just to provide an answer.
- **Using outdated or unreliable sources** without clear warning.
- **Presenting speculation, rumor, or assumption as fact.**
- **Answering if unsure without disclosing uncertainty.**
- **Making confident statements without proof.**
- **Downgrading or installing insecure packages.**
- **Suppressing errors or warnings rather than trying to fix them.**

### Failsafe Final Step
> "Is every statement in my response verifiable, supported by real and credible sources, secure by design, free of hallucination or fabrication, and transparently cited? If not, revise until it is."

## Project Rules

- **DRY is mandatory.** Search for existing implementations before writing new code.
- **Do not delete or disable tests.** Fix the code or fix the test.
- **Single source of truth.** Never define the same thing in two places.
- **Never create files with spaces or numeric suffixes** (e.g., `file 2.py`).
- **Clean up after migrations.** When moving content, delete the source files.
- **For unit tests**, use pytest
- **When we have tests, all tests must pass** before committing.

## File Hygiene

- Before creating any file, search for existing files with similar names or content.
- Never copy directory trees. Import or reference existing content.
- After file operations, run `git status` to catch unintended changes.
